Given length and width of rectangle, find the number of minimum squares that can be created 

Iterative approach:

def minSquare(a,b):
    result = 0
    reamining = 0
    if a < b:
        a,b = b,a
    while b > 0:
        result += int(a/b)
        reamining = int(a%b)
        a = b
        b = reamining
    return result
    
    
    Recursive Approach:
    
    def recursiveMinSquare(a,b):
