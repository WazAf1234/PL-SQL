# PL-SQL

This Repository is created by me (Bhushan Jain); an exciting and ventureful initiative to solve Data Structure/Algorithm questions in Oracle PL/SQL for which little or no literature ever exists (considering the usage of PLSQL language!!!)

This repository is just a glimpse of Data Structure Questions and does not contains solutions to many of the famous problems 
that I have solved in PLSQL...


Have fun referring to these solutions and any advice is welcome!!
